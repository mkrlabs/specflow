**Nothing you install has changed.** The binary and the scaffolded templates are byte-identical to
v3.0.0 — `specnaut upgrade` on a project already at 3.0.0 will find nothing to do, and that is the
correct outcome.

This release exists to harden the release pipeline itself, after a retroactive audit of how v3.0.0
shipped. Three defects would have hit the _next_ release: the hand-written highlights block
republished itself because nothing reset it; postflight aborted before printing the verdicts it had
just computed whenever the operator's local binary failed to self-update; and the docs-site refresh
reported success on dispatch acceptance rather than on the site actually being rebuilt.

A tag can now only be cut on a commit that is genuinely a release commit, with a clean tree and six
version files that agree, and the adoption gate no longer demands a user-facing guide for code that
reaches no user project.
