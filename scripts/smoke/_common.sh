# ─── Why this file exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Fifteen scripts used to open with the same four lines:
#
#   ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/../../../.." && pwd)"
#   CLI="$ROOT/apps/specnaut-cli"
#
# — a climb that hardcoded both the workspace layout AND each file's own
# depth. It is why relocating the suite was a fifteen-file edit, and why
# the suite could not run from a bare clone of this repository. Correcting
# it fifteen times would have reproduced the defect one directory deeper.
# This file is the single home for that decision (plan.md §5 R1).
#
# ─── bash 3.2 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# macOS ships bash 3.2 and the maintainer runs this suite there.
# smoke-all-harnesses.sh:19-21 already pays that cost deliberately. So:
# no `declare -A`, no `mapfile`, no `${var,,}`, no `+=` on strings.
# Code written to bash 4 passes CI on ubuntu-latest and breaks silently on
# the one machine the interactive scenarios exist for.

# --- Paths ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Derived from THIS file's location, never from the caller's cwd. A caller
# standing anywhere gets the same answer, which is what lets smoke-audit.sh
# point the audit at a synthetic tree without relocating anything.

# --- What counts as code (plan.md §5 023-R1, 023-R2, 023-R3) -------------
# A comment is not an assertion. The two guards that must tell shell code
# from commentary — audit.sh's coverage match and run-all.sh's boundary
# check — ask this; neither carries its own expression.
#
# The rule, why it is not `sed 's/#.*$//'`, and its heredoc blind spot are
# written down ONCE in README.md ("What counts as a mention"). They are not
# restated here: 023-R6 names that file as their home, and an earlier
# revision of this comment had already drifted from it on a figure.
#
# Contract, which callers depend on and which therefore belongs here:
#   * removes a SUFFIX of the line, never an interior span
#   * preserves line numbering (blanks, never deletes)
#   * returns non-zero if the file cannot be read — callers must treat that
#     as a finding, not as an empty file

# --- Suite membership (plan.md §5 R3) ------------------------------------
# The one answer to "which scripts constitute the suite". run-all.sh runs
# SUITE_FILES; audit.sh enumerates what it scans from the smoke directory
# itself and checks THIS list against that enumeration, so a script that
# exists but is not listed is a finding rather than a silent omission.
#
# There is deliberately no second list here. An earlier revision declared a
# `SCAN_FILES` alongside this one; when audit.sh moved to enumerating the
# directory, that declaration kept its documentation and lost its only
# reader — a second spelling of membership that had stopped meaning
# anything while still reading like the source of truth.

# every caller passed a literal, so nothing could go wrong; run-all.sh is

# affordance. Validate once, here, rather than in sixteen places later.
