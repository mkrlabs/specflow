# `scripts/smoke/` — the suite that runs the real binary

The Deno suite asserts what the bundle contains. These scripts assert what a user actually gets:
they scaffold throwaway projects under `sandbox/` with the working-tree binary and check the result.

```bash
bash scripts/smoke/run-all.sh              # the whole suite + the audit
bash scripts/smoke/run-all.sh --list       # suite membership
bash scripts/smoke/run-all.sh --only smoke-hooks.sh
bash scripts/smoke/run-all.sh --no-bundle    # skip the re-bundle — rarely right
bash scripts/smoke/audit.sh                # coverage + staleness only
```

`smoke.yml` runs `run-all.sh` on every push and pull request. `.specnaut/release/preflight.sh` runs
`audit.sh` before a release.

## The scripts

**Toolbox** (no assertions — building blocks for interactive work): `bootstrap-vite.sh` (brownfield
fixture; `--real` for a genuine pinned `create-vite` scaffold), `bootstrap-empty.sh`, `run-init.sh`,
`inspect.sh`, `compare-harnesses.sh`, `clean.sh`.

**The suite** — enumerated by `SUITE_FILES` in `_common.sh`, which `audit.sh` checks against the
scripts actually on disk. A script that exists but is not listed is a finding, not an omission.

**`audit.sh`** — the coverage gate. **`smoke-audit.sh`** — its meta-test.

## `_common.sh` owns five decisions

Path resolution, suite membership, the assertion harness, what a valid scenario name is, and what
counts as code in a smoke script. Source it; never re-derive any of them locally. It is written for
**bash 3.2**, because macOS ships that and the interactive scenarios exist for that machine.

## Audit heuristics

`audit.sh` compares the working tree against the newest `v*.*.*` tag and reports six findings. Every
one of them is **fatal** — exit **1**. Exit **2** means it could not resolve a baseline (a shallow
or tagless clone) and **3** that `--src-root` is unusable — not a git work tree, or not that tree's
**toplevel**; neither is a findings verdict, and `.specnaut/release/preflight.sh` branches on that
difference.

### What "the working tree" means — three sources, one pathspec

The collected set is the de-duplicated union of three git queries, all scoped by the same
`SURFACE_PATHSPEC` and all sharing the same `GIT_SRC` invocation prefix:

1. **tracked, changed since the baseline** — `git diff --diff-filter=AMR "$SINCE..HEAD"`.
2. **staged but not committed** — `git diff --diff-filter=AMR --cached HEAD`.
3. **untracked and not ignored** — `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard --full-name`.

Sources 2 and 3 arrived with #564. Before them the collection was source 1 alone, and
`git diff <a>..<b>` compares two **commits** — so a file git had never recorded was in neither, and
the gate ran blind on exactly the files it exists to catch. A wholly new surface file has no
assertion by definition; the audit stayed quiet for the whole time it was being written and went red
only once it landed.

An uncommitted path is marked in the report — `(untracked)`, `(staged, not committed)`, or
`(untracked nested repository …)` — so a red gate names its cause. That marking is report text: it
touches no counter and no term in the verdict, and an uncommitted gap is fatal through exactly the
path a committed one is.

`--exclude-standard` is what makes an ignored file invisible, and it reads three sources: the tree's
`.gitignore` files, `$GIT_DIR/info/exclude`, and the user's machine-global excludes file. The third
is pinned out with `-c core.excludesFile=/dev/null`, so the verdict is a property of the tree rather
than of the laptop. This is `scripts/smoke/audit.sh`'s decision; **this document is derived from
it**, and where the two disagree the script wins.

| Finding                           | What it means                                                                                                                                                                |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coverage gap**                  | A changed file under a mapped surface that no smoke names by basename. Fatal unless allow-listed with a written reason.                                                      |
| **Stale assertion**               | A smoke references a runtime path with no source counterpart under `templates/`.                                                                                             |
| **Capture read only in a `fail`** | A `name=$(…)` capture whose only reader sits inside a `fail`. The `fail` runs _after_ the assertion decided, so the value never reached a verdict.                           |
| **Stale allowlist entry**         | An allow-listed path that no longer exists, or an entry with no written reason.                                                                                              |
| **Suite-membership drift**        | `SUITE_FILES` and the scripts on disk disagree.                                                                                                                              |
| **Unmapped surface**              | A collected file that no `SURFACES` glob claims — anywhere in the collected surface, not just `templates/core/`. Fatal since #549 — the defect is invisibility, not the gap. |

Two things are reported and are deliberately **not** fatal: a gap that carries a written allow-list
reason, and a change under `src/cli/`, which is counted in its own class because it is not a
scaffolded surface at all.

### An assertion that cannot fail

The unread-capture scan (#550) is one lexical shape of a wider class, and the only shape a grep can
decide. It is **not** a claim that the suite's assertions are meaningful — 024-R4 forbids that
framing, and it still holds. It proves that a captured value is _read_ somewhere other than a
diagnostic; it says nothing about the comparison that read feeds.

The program is `unread-captures.awk`, and it is resolved from the script's own directory, never
through `--smoke-dir`: the scan's program is not a fixture and does not live in a synthetic tree. It
skips heredoc bodies (they are data, and this suite embeds shell in them), treats `$((…))` as
arithmetic rather than a capture, and requires a word boundary after a name so `$fooX` is not a read
of `foo`. A missing or erroring program is reported as a finding, not as a clean scan.

The complete answer to this class is mutation testing — deliberately breaking the code under test to
prove each assertion goes red. That is what found all three of #546's constant-true assertions, and
it is a far larger ticket.

The surface map lives in the `SURFACES` array in `audit.sh`; each entry is
`<glob>|<smoke-script-list>|<kind>`. The stale scan walks the smoke scripts it enumerates from the
smoke directory itself — there is no second list to keep in step — extracts each `.claude/…` /
`.specnaut/…` token, and maps it back to a candidate under `templates/core/` or
`templates/harness-specific/<harness>/`. Runtime-only paths (`installed.lock`, `specs/`, `logs/`, …)
are skipped explicitly, and a path a smoke only ever asserts the **absence** of is not stale — that
is the correct assertion for a deliberately removed artefact.

### What counts as a mention

A basename found **only inside a comment does not count as coverage**. A comment resolves nothing
and asserts nothing, and a comment saying a file is deliberately uncovered would otherwise vouch for
it. The rule is about what a script _does_, not what it mentions.

`_common.sh`'s `smoke_code_lines()` is the single home for that decision, and both guards that need
it — the coverage match here and `run-all.sh`'s boundary check — ask it rather than carrying their
own expression. It tracks single and double quotes and cuts at the first **unquoted** `#` that
begins a word.

Two properties the callers depend on, and the reason the rule is not simply `sed 's/#.*$//'`:

- **It removes a suffix, never an interior span.** Every output line is a prefix of its input, so a
  fixed-string search can lose a match but never invent one. Coverage detection therefore fails
  **closed** by construction — the direction a gate must fail in.
- **Line numbering is preserved.** Lines are blanked, never dropped, so a caller reporting
  `file:line` still reports the right one.

The naive expression cuts at the _first_ `#` on a line, and shell puts one inside `${var#prefix}`
and inside every `echo "═══ #180  add.sh …"` banner this suite writes. Measured over these scripts
it discards several hundred lines of real code against the genuine comments it is meant to remove.

**Known limit, stated plainly:** heredoc bodies are **not recognised**. The scan resets on every
line and holds no notion of an open heredoc, so **a `#` inside a heredoc body is scored exactly as
if the line were shell** — as the start of a comment when whitespace precedes it and it sits outside
quotes _on that line_, and as ordinary text otherwise. This suite embeds `.gitignore`, CSS, Markdown
and Python inside heredocs, where a `#` is not a shell comment at all, so such a line can be
truncated. The damage is bounded to the one line, and it falls in the safe direction: a truncated
line can lose a coverage match, never invent one.

### What identifies a changed file

Coverage is decided by grepping the mapped smoke for a **token** derived from the changed file. For
almost every surface that token is the basename, and that is deliberate rather than tolerated: the
smokes assert in loops, and their lists are written out with literal names _so this grep can find
them_ — see the notes at the top of the backlog smokes and above the phase block in
`smoke-features.sh`. Matching the runtime path a source file scaffolds to would be invisible to
those loops, and was measured reporting false gaps on a fifth of a release window's changes.

One surface is different. Every skill's file is named `SKILL.md`, a string this suite contains many
times over, so a basename token was constant-true across all of them and skills could ship asserted
on by nothing. There the token is the runtime path suffix, `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. **Not** the
bare skill name: a skill can be named inside an assertion whose subject is a _different_ file, and
the bare name would count that as coverage.

**What this measures is a mention, not an assertion.** A smoke that merely spells a path satisfies
the scan; whether it asserts anything about that file is not checked, and cannot be without parsing
the smoke — a line this suite has declined to cross every time it has come up. Treat a green
coverage scan as "somebody named this file", not as "somebody tested it".

A file with no runtime path at all — a source-only reference meant to be copied rather than
scaffolded — cannot be covered by any assertion. That belongs in `coverage-allowlist.txt` with its
reason, like any other gap the maintainer accepts.

The audit reports; it never edits a smoke script.

## Deferring an assertion

Add the path to `coverage-allowlist.txt` **with a written reason**. An entry without one is ignored,
so the gap stays fatal. `audit.sh` reports an entry whose file has disappeared, so the file cannot
quietly become a dumping ground.

## Conventions

- Scenarios live in `sandbox/<name>/`, which is gitignored. They are wiped on every exit path.
- The scripts run `deno run --allow-all src/main.ts` — the working tree, not an installed binary.
- `--no-bundle` skips that re-bundle. It is the only flag that changes what the suite asserts
  against, which is why it is almost never the right one.
- `run-all.sh` runs `deno task bundle` first and restores the file afterwards. `specnaut init`
  scaffolds from the generated `src/templates_bundle.ts`, so a suite that skips that step asserts
  against a stale artefact and goes green on a change it never saw.
- All scripts are idempotent; re-running is always safe.
