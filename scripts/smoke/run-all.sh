# The suite's single entry point. Runs every script in SUITE_FILES against
# the working tree and exits non-zero if any of them is red.
#
# Usage:
#   run-all.sh                 # the whole suite
#   run-all.sh --list          # print the suite membership and exit
#   run-all.sh --only <script> # one script (name from --list)
#   run-all.sh --no-bundle     # skip the re-bundle (see below — rarely right)
#
# ─── Why it bundles first ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `specnaut init` scaffolds from the GENERATED src/templates_bundle.ts, not
# from templates/ on disk. Verified: a marker appended to a file under
# templates/core/ without re-bundling does not appear in the scaffolded
# output at all.
#
# So a suite that does not bundle first asserts against whatever the bundle
# held when it was last regenerated — it would go green on a change it never
# saw. That is the same defect the suite exists to catch, one level up: a
# mechanism reporting success without having read what it claims to cover.
#
# The regenerated file is restored on exit, because it is a TRACKED file and
# `.specnaut/release/preflight.sh` aborts on a dirty tree. Running the suite
# must not leave the repository in a state that fails an unrelated gate.

# --- FR-001: the suite guards its own boundary --------------------------
# Every script must resolve its paths inside this repository. This used to be
# a grep a person ran once, for a defect whose entire history is that it
# rots; running it here makes a green run the evidence.
#
# Comments are stripped first: _common.sh documents the old workspace climb
# by quoting it, and a comment resolves nothing. The rule is about what the
# code DOES, not what it mentions. What counts as a comment is decided in
# _common.sh (plan.md §5 023-R1), not here.
#
# The pattern is ASSEMBLED, never written out in full. This block IS the
# check, so a pattern spelled literally here makes the guard match its own
# source. #544 settled the shape of the answer: assemble from fragments
# (smoke-toolbox.sh:38 does the same with `up=".."`); exempting the file
# that holds a check is a hole in the check, not a fix for one.
#
# It stayed hidden while this loop stripped comments inline with
# `sed 's/#.*$//'` — that expression cut this very line at the hash inside
# itself and erased the pattern before grep ever saw it. Only the workspace
# half ever self-matched; the escaped `\.\./…` half never did.

  # this guard was blind to part of its own surface.
  #
  # `grep -c` consumes all input, so unlike audit.sh's `grep -q` there is no
  # early exit to SIGPIPE the producer under pipefail.
  # A file this cannot read is NOT a file with no violations. The inline
  # `sed` this replaces had the same hole — it printed to stderr, produced
