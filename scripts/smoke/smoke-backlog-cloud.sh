# Verify the Specnaut Cloud backend's backlog scaffolding ships every script
# the PO + grooming + epic contracts depend on. File presence, executable
# bits, and the contracts each script declares — no live API calls (behaviour
# against a real board is integration territory).
#
# #563 created this file. The cloud backend had NO smoke at all and no glob in
# audit.sh's SURFACES map, so every script it ships was asserted on by nothing
# — the audit's own coverage scan could not see the gap because no glob
# claimed the directory. That is the same shape as the defects this suite
# exists to find: not a missing guard, a guard blind to part of its surface.
