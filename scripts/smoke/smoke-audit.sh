# Smoke test for `audit.sh` itself. Builds a self-contained synthetic repo,
# plants one of each finding type the audit is supposed to detect, and runs
# the REAL audit.sh against it.
#
# ─── Why it no longer copies audit.sh ────────────────────────────────────
# The previous version copied audit.sh alone into the synthetic tree and ran
# the copy. That made the meta-test depend on audit.sh deriving its source
# tree from wherever the file happened to sit — so the moment audit.sh
# gained a shared header (_common.sh), the single-file copy would have died
# at its first `source`, and any location-based derivation would have
# silently pointed it at the wrong directory.
#
# The audit's source tree and smoke directory are now explicit parameters,
# so this test points the real script at a synthetic tree instead of
# relocating it. That also deletes the question "is the copy still the same
# as the original" — there is no copy.
#
# ─── What it asserts ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   1. a new bundled file with no assertion is reported (coverage gap)
#   2. an assertion referencing a deleted file is reported (staleness)
#   3. the summary counts exactly one of each
#   3b. a changed file under NO mapped surface is reported as unmapped
#       rather than passing in silence — and is not fatal by itself
#   3c. the allowlist escape actually works AND actually flips the verdict —
#       an untested escape hatch is how a gate quietly stops gating
#   3d. a stale allowlist entry — one whose file is gone — is reported, so
#       the allowlist cannot outlive what it excuses
#   3e. the exit codes that mean "could not run" (2, 3) are distinct from the
#       one that means "found things" (1); .specnaut/release/preflight.sh
#       branches on that difference and would otherwise blame a shallow clone
#       for coverage gaps
#   3f. a basename that appears ONLY inside a comment is not coverage —
#       a comment resolves nothing, and one saying a file is deliberately
#       uncovered would otherwise vouch for it (#545)
#   3l. an UNCOMMITTED surface file — untracked or merely staged — is seen
#       at all (#564). Until then the collection was `git diff <a>..<b>`, which
#       compares two COMMITS, so a file git had never recorded was in neither
#       and the gate ran blind on precisely the files it exists to catch.
#       Includes the paired --exclude-standard control, the pathspec control,
#       the union's de-duplication, the nested-repository shape, the
#       machine-global excludes pin, idempotence, and the invariant that no
#       collected path is ever OPENED.
#   4. the EXIT CODE is the verdict: 0 on a clean tree, non-zero with
#      findings. The old version wrapped the call in `|| true` and grepped
#      only stdout, so it passed identically whether audit.sh exited 0, 1 or
#      99 — it could not have detected the contract it exists to guard.

# the array: they are the only independent opinion in the suite about what that

# currently says, so no assertion here can ever fail on a wrong pathspec.
