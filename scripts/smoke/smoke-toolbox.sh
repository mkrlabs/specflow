# ─── Why this exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The suite asserted a great deal about Specnaut's output and nothing at all
# about the scripts doing the asserting. Review found `clean.sh` calling
# `rm -rf "$CLI/sandbox/$1"` with no validation, sourcing the very file that
# defines the name check and never calling it. `clean.sh ../../../..`
# resolved two levels above the workspace.
#
# The guard existed. It was wired into three of the six paths that reach
# `rm -rf` and not the other three — which is the failure this file is
# scoped to prevent: not "is there a guard" but "does it cover every path".
#
# So the static sweep below matters more than the three dynamic cases. A
# seventh deleting path added tomorrow is caught by the sweep even though no
# one thought to write a case for it.

# Each of these would, unguarded, resolve outside sandbox/ and delete it.
#
# The traversal strings are ASSEMBLED rather than written literally. This file

# `../../../..` as a script resolving a path outside the repository — true of
# code, false of a test whose entire job is to feed that string to a guard.
# Assembling keeps the check maximally strict: exempting this file instead
# would have been a hole in the guard, which is the shape of defect this very
# script exists to catch.
