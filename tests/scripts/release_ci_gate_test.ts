/**
 * The tag is what publishes, and nothing in `release.yml` used to ask whether
 * the commit it points at is green.
 *
 * `ci.yml` runs the suite on three OSes on every push to `main`; the release
 * workflow runs none of it. So a tag pushed over a red `main` compiled,
 * checksummed and published a Release, entirely green, with a known-failing
 * commit inside. The only thing in the way was `preflight.sh` — a script an
 * operator runs locally, can skip, and which this workflow cannot consult.
 *
 * The gate is a wait, not a read, because `ci` on that SHA starts at the same
 * moment as the release workflow. So four outcomes have to be told apart, and
 * only one of them blocks. These tests run the step's actual shell against a
 * stubbed `gh` for each: what this gate does when it CANNOT answer matters as
 * much as what it does when it can, and a gate that blocks on absence would
 * make an unverifiable repository unable to release at all.
