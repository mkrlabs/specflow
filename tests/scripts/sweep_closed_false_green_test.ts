/**
 * The board-drift detector made three reads per pass and discarded the error
 * from every one of them. Two then substituted an empty value, and an empty
 * value is indistinguishable from a real "nothing to report".
 *
 * The project read at least announced itself — but in the vocabulary of a
 * permanent misconfiguration: `could not read Project #N for owner X`, when
 * the number and the owner were both correct and the cause was a rate limit.
 *
 * The other two are the **false green**. `gh issue list --state closed …
 * || echo '[]'` means a failed read produces "nothing was closed in the
 * window", so the drift set is empty, the summary prints `drifted 0`, and the
 * script exits 0 over a board with any amount of drift. The `scanned 0` guard
 * cannot see it: the project read succeeded, and only the second call failed.
 *
 * That is why the second scenario below is the one that matters. The first
 * fixes a message; the second fixes an answer.
