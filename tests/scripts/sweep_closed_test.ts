/**
 * Behavioural tests for `github/sweep-closed.sh`.
 *
 * The other backlog-script tests in this directory assert on the script's
 * *text* — they pin which commands it calls. That convention cannot reach what
 * matters here: this script's risk is not which calls it makes but what it
 * concludes, and its worst failure produces no output at all. So these run the
 * script against a stubbed `gh` and assert on what it decides.
 *
 * Stubbing rather than restating the jq is deliberate. Re-expressing the
 * filters in the test would create a second definition of "drifted" that can
 * disagree with the first — the exact defect this whole seam exists to remove.
