/**
 * Two shipped components disagreed about whether a state was valid, and one of
 * them created it on purpose.
 *
 * `propagate-parent-status.sh` advanced a parent to **Done** when its last open
 * child reached Done — it calls `move.sh` and closes nothing. So the parent's
 * card read Done while the parent issue was still open, which is precisely what
 * `sweep-closed.sh` names in its own header: `REOPENED — open, but sitting in
 * Done`, one of the three drifts the detector exists to report.
 *
 * The window was structural. The promotion fires at the CHILD's move, which
 * necessarily precedes any close of the parent, and nothing obliges a caller to
 * close it. `phases/merge-close.md` closes the epic itself under the cascade
 * gate and never invokes this hook, so the only path the promotion decided
 * anything on was the one where nobody closes the parent.
 *
 * `Done` means the work is finished. "Every child is Done" is not that — the
 * parent may carry its own residual work, and `cascade-check.sh` exists to gate
 * that judgement, which this hook deliberately does not consult. `In review` is
 * the column the evidence supports. A parent already closed still goes to Done:
 * there the card is only lagging a fact already established, and that case is
 * what keeps this fix from being "never promote".
