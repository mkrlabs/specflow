 *
 * The two holes this file is built to avoid were both observed on the #576
 * equivalent and are pinned here rather than rediscovered: asserting the routes
 * with an OR (so one route satisfies every harness and the other decides
 * nothing), and asserting that a pointer EXISTS while never asserting the
 * pointed-at file is delivered — a project told to read something it never
 * received. Each route is asserted alone; delivery is asserted apart from
 * reference. No harness is exempt.
