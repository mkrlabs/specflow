/**
 * The bundled `/loop` prompt promised that `/board groom` "flags orphan specs".
 * `groom.md` said the check was not its business and had moved. No line in it
 * told anyone to read the file it named, and `auto-chain.md` — believing
 * itself reachable — said to run the walk "from a grooming pass".
 *
 * Three documents, one scheduled loop advertising the check, and nothing that
 * executed it.
 *
 * The guard here has to survive a specific near-miss: `groom.md` ALREADY
 * contained the string `phases/auto-chain.md` before the fix, inside the
 * sentence disowning the work. A test asserting the filename appears would
 * have passed against the broken tree. What is asserted is the **instruction**,
 * and the count of checks is derived from the headings rather than trusted
 * from the prose.
