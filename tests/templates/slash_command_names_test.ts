/**
 * A shipped file must not name a slash command the bundle does not emit.
 *
 * `specify-rules.mdc` advertised `/specnaut-backlog` to Cursor users. The
 * skill folder is named by `skillFolderName`, which had started emitting
 * `specnaut-board` — so the one file telling a Cursor user what to type named
 * a command that does not exist there.
 *
 * It survived a full rename sweep because the sweep matched `/backlog` and
 * this string is `/specnaut-backlog`: the same skill under the name a harness
 * gives it. Prose naming a *generated* identifier has to be checked against
 * the generator, not against the identifier's other spelling.
 *
 * Scoped to the `specnaut-` prefixed form on purpose. That form is produced
 * entirely by `skillFolderName`, so the valid set is derivable and the check
 * has no judgement in it. Bare `/specnaut <phase>` is a subcommand, not a
 * folder, and harness built-ins like `/loop` are none of our business.
