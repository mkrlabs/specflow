/**
 * `using-specnaut/SKILL.md` tells the agent to read a tool-name mapping before
 * invoking anything. For a long time it named `references/<harness>-tools.md`,
 * files that were authored but never registered — so every scaffolded project
 * shipped an instruction pointing at nothing (#441).
 *
 * The fix hinges on a fact the old text obscured: `specnaut init --ai <harness>`
 * fixes the harness at scaffold time, so exactly ONE mapping is ever relevant.
 * It ships at a harness-neutral path, `.specnaut/harness-tools.md`, which also
 * sidesteps the folder/flat split — Windsurf and Copilot flatten a skill into a
 * single file and have nowhere to put a `references/` directory.
 *
 * The plugin distribution is the other case: there the harness is unknown, so
 * all five references ship side by side and the agent detects its own. Both
 * paths are described in the skill, and both must actually resolve.
