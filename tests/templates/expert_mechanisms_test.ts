/**
 * Locks the two grounding mechanisms that need no catalogue.
 *
 * Four mechanisms make an expert seat answerable for what it ships. Two of
 * them require something to point at — cite the leaf, read its negative
 * section before each finding — and belong to whichever catalogue the seat
 * has. The other two work against *whatever* source a seat has, including a
 * project's own constitution, so they apply everywhere and are asserted here
 * for the whole set at once.
 *
 * The wording is byte-identical across these seats on purpose: a sixth seat
 * should be able to copy it rather than paraphrase it, and a paraphrase is how
 * "drop it to LOW and label it" quietly becomes "mention it".
 *
 * `architect-expert` and `security-expert` carry semantically equivalent
 * phrasings from the earlier programme, worded around their own artefact
 * ("leaf", "domain file"). Harmonising those two is deliberately not done
 * here — rebuilding what that programme shipped is explicitly out of scope,
 * and both already fail their own guards if the mechanism disappears.
