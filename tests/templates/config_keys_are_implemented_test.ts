// No shipped surface may promise a config key that no shipped script reads (#566).
//
// The defect this binds: `backlog-config.yml` shipped `project_node_id` and
// `status_field_id` with a comment saying they were "cached on first run", and
// the board skill documented a PO that would refresh them automatically when
// blank. Nothing implemented any of it. A user filling them in — or waiting for
// them to populate — was reading a promise the product never made good on, and
// nothing in the suite could tell, because an inert key breaks no behaviour.
//
// The class is broader than those two keys: a documented key with no reader is
// a promise, and the population that must satisfy it is "every key a shipped
// stub emits or a shipped doc shows", derived rather than listed. A test
// enumerating the two known-bad keys would go green the moment a third appeared.
