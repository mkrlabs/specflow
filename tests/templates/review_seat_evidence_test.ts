/**
 * monorepo#28 — a review seat's own `SEATS_REPORTED` count is taken on trust.
 *
 * `review-findings-contract` now requires `EVIDENCE` on a clean report, and the
 * coordinator counts a clean seat that names none as `NOT RUN`. That check only
 * works if EVERY seat knows to emit the field: a coordinator enforcing it
 * against seats that never learned about it fails every honest review.
 *
 * monorepo#23 shipped exactly that mistake — two contract fields added and
 * ported to two of eight seats. It was caught by writing a SWEEP over every
 * seat rather than a case for the seat under discussion, which is why this file
 * derives its subjects from the bundle's own `skills:` frontmatter instead of
 * listing them. A ninth seat added tomorrow is covered on the day it lands.
