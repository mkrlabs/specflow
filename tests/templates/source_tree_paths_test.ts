 *
 * `backlog-reference-contract` pointed at `skills/backlog/scripts/<backend>/
 * _config.sh` — where that file lives in the bundle source. Installed, it is
 * `.specnaut/scripts/backlog/_config.sh`, flat, with no `<backend>` segment,
 * and identical under all seven harnesses. Three separate errors in one line.
 *
 * The class matters more than the instance: a doc written and verified inside
 * this checkout, where the path resolves, then shipped where it does not. It
 * is invisible to anyone testing from a checkout, and it fails *quietly* — an
 * agent that cannot find `_config.sh` does not error, it assembles the URL by
 * hand, which is the exact thing the contract exists to prevent.
 *
 * Filed as specnaut-cli#541, which named two instances. This scan found eight.
