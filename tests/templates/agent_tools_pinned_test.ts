// Every bundled seat's `tools:` line is pinned (#573).

// Nothing asserted these before. That means nothing pinned the present values,
// and nothing would notice a future drift of them — including the silent LOSS
// of a grant. `test-reviewer` carries `Bash(deno test *)` so that a rule about
// whether an assertion bites can be settled by running something; if that
// suffix were dropped in a later edit, the seat would go back to reporting
// behavioural claims from reading and the only symptom would be reviews that
// look exactly as confident as before.
//
// A tools line is also the seat's authority boundary. Widening one is a real
// decision — this test makes it a visible one, by refusing to pass until the
// expected value here is changed too.
