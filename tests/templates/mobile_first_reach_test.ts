/**
 * REACH, not shape (#576, FR-015).
 *
 * Every other assertion about this contract asks whether the templates have the
 * right shape. None of them can fail when the contract reaches no turn.
 *
 * The first version of this file was green for the wrong reason twice over, and
 * both holes are pinned below. It looped over `HARNESS_STATIC` and over the
 * `ui-defaults` fence and passed if EITHER carried the pointer — so the fence
 * alone satisfied all seven harnesses and the static loop could never decide
 * anything. Observed: deleting the pointer from all three harness context files
 * left it green. And it asserted that a pointer EXISTS while never asserting the
 * pointed-at skill is delivered, so a project could be told to read a file it
 * never received.
 *
 * Each route is now asserted on its own terms, and delivery is asserted apart
 * from reference. No harness is exempt.
