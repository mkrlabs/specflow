/**
 * Every file authored under `templates/` must be registered in
 * `templates/manifest.json`, because the bundler emits only what the manifest
 * lists. An unregistered file is authored, reviewable, greppable — and absent
 * from every user's project.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical. Four instances shipped that way:
 *
 *   - `using-specnaut/SKILL.md` pointed at five `references/*-tools.md`
 *     files that were never registered, so every scaffolded project shipped a
 *     skill instructing the agent to read files that did not exist (#441).
 *   - `backlog/scripts/local/_config.sh` (#450) — the local backend's
 *     `item_url` helper existed in no project.
 *   - `backlog/scripts/cloud/columns.sh` and `reconcile.sh` (#450) — both
 *     documented in SKILL.md and invoked by the product-owner agent, neither
 *     ever scaffolded.
 *
 * The existing suite could not catch any of them: every other assertion reads
 * the authored template source, and the authored file was always there.
 * Nothing read the manifest, which is what decides what ships.
