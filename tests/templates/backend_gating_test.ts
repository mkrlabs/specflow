 * A backend-specific artefact must not ship to a project that chose a different
 * backend.
 *
 * `.specnaut/backlog.md` did. Its manifest entry carried no `backend` key while
 * 38 siblings — every backlog script among them — were gated, so it shipped
 * unconditionally. Its own opening lines describe the local backend ("Each task
 * is one file under `.specnaut/backlog/NNN-slug.md`"), which meant a project
 * whose lock reads `backlog_backend: github` had a local Markdown backlog index
 * created in its tree: a second, empty source of truth for data that lives on a
 * GitHub Project.
 *
 * A missing gate is invisible — the file simply appears, under "new files to
 * add", looking like any other addition. Nothing distinguishes "belongs here"
 * from "nobody said it didn't".
