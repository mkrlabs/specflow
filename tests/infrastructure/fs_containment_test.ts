 * Registers a test that needs `Deno.symlink`.
 *
 * Windows refuses symlink creation without Developer Mode or elevation, so
 * every fixture in this file fails there for a reason that has nothing to do
 * with the code under test. Registered as IGNORED rather than short-circuited
 * inside the body: a test that returns early reports as PASSED, and a green
 * that never ran is the exact failure this whole feature is about.
 *
 * The consequence is stated rather than hidden: **containment is not covered on
 * Windows.** The code is platform-neutral by construction — `relative()` and
 * `@std/path` throughout, never a hardcoded separator — but that is an argument,
 * not a measurement. `write_bundle_symlink_test.ts` has skipped Windows the same
 * way since before this change.
