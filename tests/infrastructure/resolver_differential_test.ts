/**
 * The kernel is the oracle.
 *
 * Two review rounds each found a CRITICAL in `resolveTarget`, both real, both
 * the same shape: a layout where our resolution disagreed with what the
 * operating system actually does. Round 1 was `..` collapsed against an
 * unresolved parent. Round 2 was following one hop where the kernel follows a
 * chain. Adding a case per round does not terminate — the space of symlink
 * layouts is not enumerable by imagination, and every fixed depth is the same
 * bug waiting for one more link.
 *
 * So this test stops guessing and asks the OS. For each layout it computes the
 * ONE thing the guard actually needs to know — *where would a write to this
 * path land* — by writing a marker and asking `realPath` where it went. Then it
 * requires `resolveTarget` to have said the same thing.
 *
 * A disagreement here is a containment hole by definition, whatever shape it
 * takes, including shapes nobody has thought of yet.
