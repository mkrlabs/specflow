/**
 * Every module that mutates the filesystem either asks the containment rule or
 * carries a written reason why it does not (cli#574).
 *
 * This exists because the rule is a property of a CLASS, and a class with no
 * membership test grows members that never learn about it. Nine modules mutated
 * the filesystem when the rule was written; the ticket named two of them and the
 * first version of the plan named four. The answer to that is not a longer list
 * — the list is what produced the miss — it is a walk of the tree.
 *
 * The failure this catches is the tenth adapter: someone adds a store, builds a
 * path under `projectDir`, writes, and nothing anywhere tells them a rule
 * exists. Without this test that lands green.
