/**
 * #519 — the upgrade report described the plan and called it the outcome.
 *
 * Three defects, one root: `renderSummary` was handed the pre-write plan and
 * never learned what the run had written. Under `--force` that made it state
 * the opposite of the truth twice over — every overwritten file was listed as
 * "customized locally (not touched)", and the files that had just received a
 * long-delayed update were the ones warned to have missed it permanently.
 *
 * The third defect is `--reset-baseline`: it re-baselined the entire
 * `customized` bucket rather than the "behind" list its own hint advertises,
 * and wrote none of the `.specnaut.bak` copies that hint promises.
