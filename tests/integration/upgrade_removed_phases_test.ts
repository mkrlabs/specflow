/**
 * #460 — `specnaut upgrade` must leave no orphan behind from the phases #455
 * deleted.
 *
 * The removal machinery is lock-driven and already existed: a lock entry that
 * is no longer in the new bundle becomes a `remove` action when the file is
 * still on disk. What did NOT exist is a test proving it for THIS set of files,
 * and "the mechanism is generic so it must work" is exactly the assumption that
 * ships a project still carrying `phases/specify.md` next to a router that no
 * longer routes to it — a stale file an agent can still read and act on.
 *
 * So this simulates a pre-#455 install honestly: real files on disk, real
 * entries in the lock with real hashes, then a real upgrade.
