/**
 * #516 — `--dry-run` is documented as "Show the plan without writing", and
 * ends by printing "(dry-run — no files written)". It wrote twice anyway:
 *
 *   1. The rebrand migration `.specflow/` → `.specnaut/` ran eleven lines
 *      above the first dry-run guard, so a preview silently renamed the
 *      managed tree.
 *   2. Staging was populated in dry-run "so the agent can preview the
 *      reconciliation plan" — which also primed `specnaut reconcile` with
 *      upstream content for an upgrade that was never applied.
 *
 * These tests assert the property directly, on the tree. Asserting on stdout
 * is not enough: the whole defect was that stdout said nothing had happened.
