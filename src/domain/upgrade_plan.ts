 *   - `newShas`  : SHA of each file in the binary's embedded templates
 *

 *   - `pluginInstalled`  : whether the `specnaut-plugin` plugin is on
 *                          the host (probed at use-case entry by the
 *                          `PluginDetector` port).

 *                          when the plugin owns a copy of `dest`. See
 *                          `plugin_coverage.ts` for the canonical map.
 *
 * Behavior on plugin-covered dests when the plugin is installed:
 *   - vanilla on disk (SHA matches lock) → `migrate-to-plugin` (the
 *     binary backs the file up, deletes the on-disk copy, and drops
 *     the lock entry; the plugin serves the file going forward).
 *   - customized on disk (SHA differs from lock) → `preserve` with
 *     `pluginAvailable: true` (handler surfaces the reconcile warning).
 *
 * For uncovered dests, or any dest when the plugin is not installed,
 * behavior is identical to before the migration table existed.
 *
 * Emits one UpgradeAction per destination in the new bundle, plus a
 * `remove` action for each lock entry that is no longer in the new
 * bundle but is still on disk. Orphan entries that are not on disk
 * produce no action — the caller drops them from the new lock
 * implicitly by iterating only `newShas`.
