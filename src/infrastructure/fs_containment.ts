 * inside `DenoFsWriter` for one reason: **seven other adapters have to ask the
 * same question.** `FsLockStore`, `FsUpgradeMarkerStore`, `FsPreserveStore`,
 * `SpecCacheWriter`, the backlog-config stub and the cloud-config writer all
 * build paths under a project directory and none of them has any business
 * importing the bundle writer to find out whether a path is safe.
 *
 * The plan's first decision table put this inside `deno_fs_writer.ts`. That

 * adapter import or a local copy of the predicate — the exact duplication the
 * table exists to prevent, arriving through the table itself.

 *
 * Three states, distinguished with `lstat` and never by catching one exception:
 *
 *  1. **Absent** — resolve the parent and append the leaf. Nothing to follow.
 *  2. **A symlink** — follow it, one hop at a time, until the leaf is not a
 *     link. A *dangling* link resolves to where it points rather than to
 *     nothing: `Deno.writeTextFile` on a dangling link CREATES the target, so
 *     treating "cannot resolve" as "does not exist" is itself the escape this
 *     function exists to close.
 *  3. **Anything else** — `realPath`.
 *
 * The naive version of this is "try `realPath(abs)`, fall back to the parent on
 * `NotFound`". It is wrong, and quietly: `realPath` raises `NotFound` for a
 * dangling link and for an absent file alike, so the fallback says "inside" for
 * a link pointing anywhere at all.
 *
 * An earlier version of this comment claimed `realPath` does NOT throw on a
 * dangling link. That was false, and it was false because the probe that
 * "measured" it had already written through the link and created the target
 * before asking. The correction is kept here: a measurement taken after the
 * state it measures has changed is not a measurement.
