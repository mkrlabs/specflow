# Verify that a parent task is safe to close — every sub-task must already sit
# in the board's terminal column. Cloud-backend twin, same exit contract as the
# github script so callers need no per-backend branching.
#
# Usage:   cascade-check.sh <task-number>
# Exit:    0  no open children — safe to close
#          11 at least one child is still open — close blocked
#          12 the parent is already in the terminal column — nothing to gate
#          3  the parent does not exist, or the lookup failed
#          2  usage error
#
# --- Which column means "done" -------------------------------------------
# The hosted board's columns are the project's own: an order and a name, and
# nothing that declares one terminal. So this takes the LAST column by order
# and NAMES IT on every run.
#
# That naming is the whole safety of the convention. A board that grew a
# column after its done column would otherwise silently stop gating, and an
# epic would close over unfinished children with no sign anything was wrong.
# Announced, a wrong target is visible in the first line of output.
