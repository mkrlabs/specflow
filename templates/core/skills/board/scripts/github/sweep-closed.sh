#!/usr/bin/env bash
# List backlog items whose board column disagrees with the issue's real state.
#
# This script REPORTS. It never moves a card. Detection and correction are
# split on purpose: `/board groom` prints this output read-only, while
# `/specnaut merge` pipes the DRIFTED lines into `move.sh`. A read-only core
# cannot mutate anything from the wrong caller, and both callers get the same
# answer to "what drifted".
#
# Why reconcile rather than attribute: asking "which issues did my merge close"
# reports success from its own belief about the answer, and every failure in
# that shape is silent. Asking "does the board agree with the repository"
# makes the success criterion the outcome itself.
#
# Output (machine-readable, one per line):
#
#   DRIFTED  <number> <current-status>   closed, but not in Done
#   REOPENED <number>                    open, but sitting in Done
#   scanned <N>, drifted <M>, reopened <R>
#
# **Read the summary line, not the absence of DRIFTED lines.** `drifted 0` is a
# normal quiet run; `scanned 0` is a failure — it means the query matched
# nothing at all, which looks identical to a clean board. That distinction is
# the whole point of the summary existing.
#
# Scope: this repository only, and issues closed within --since hours. The
# board is org-wide, so an unscoped sweep would report cards this repository's
# work never touched.
#
# `--passes 2` re-scans after a short pause and unions the results. GitHub's
# auto-close lands 1–2s after the push, so a sweep run immediately by the merge
# phase can legitimately see an issue that is not closed *yet* — and a single
# pass would report a clean board with total confidence. Grooming needs no
# second pass; a merge does.
