# List backlog items whose Status:: label disagrees with the issue's real state.
#
# This script REPORTS. It never moves an issue. Detection and correction are
# split on purpose: `/board groom` prints this output read-only, while
# `/specnaut merge` pipes the DRIFTED lines into `move.sh`.
#
# Why reconcile rather than attribute: asking "which issues did my merge close"
# reports success from its own belief about the answer, and every failure in
# that shape is silent. Asking "does the board agree with the repository" makes
# the success criterion the outcome itself.
#
# Output (machine-readable, one per line):
#
#   DRIFTED  <number> <current-status>   closed, but not labelled Status::Done
#   REOPENED <number>                    open, but labelled Status::Done
#   scanned <N>, drifted <M>, reopened <R>
#
# **Read the summary line, not the absence of DRIFTED lines.** `drifted 0` is a
# normal quiet run; `scanned 0` is a failure — the query matched nothing at all,
# which looks identical to a clean board.
#
# Unlike the GitHub backend there is no separate board object here: the
# Status:: scoped label *is* the column, and it lives on the issue. So one
# listing answers both halves, and there is no cross-repository scope to guard
# — a GitLab project is the unit.

# A failed read is not an empty one.

# Every read below used to end `2>/dev/null || echo '[]'` — substituting a
# value nobody read. For the project read that produced a misleading message.
# For the two issue reads it produced a FALSE GREEN: an empty closed-issue list
# means "nothing closed in the window", so the drift set is empty, the summary
# prints `drifted 0`, and this script exits 0 over a board with any amount of
# drift. The `scanned 0` guard cannot see it — the project read succeeded and
# only the second call failed.

# and it sent the reader to check a token that was fine.

# `cloud/cascade-check.sh` uses throughout. Deliberately NOT a helper that

# empty output, and the caller carries on — which is this defect wearing a
