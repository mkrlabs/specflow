# Run one declared quality-gate tier.
#
#   run-gate.sh <fast|full>
#
# Reads `.specnaut/gates.yml` and runs the commands under `fast_gate:` or
# `full_gate:`, in order, from the repository root.
#
# This script is the ONE place the declaration is parsed. The per-child loop
# and the pre-merge step both call it; neither reads the file itself. A second
# parser is a second definition of what a gate is, and the two drift.
#
# It names no test tool, runner or framework, and it never will: the commands
# come from the project's file and are executed verbatim. There is nowhere in
# here for a tool name to be written.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0   every command succeeded, OR the tier is not declared (see below)
#   1   a command exited non-zero — the tier failed
#   2   usage error
#
# A tier that is not declared is NOT a failure. A project with no gates.yml,
# or with an empty list, behaves exactly as it did before this file existed.
# The script says so on stdout rather than passing in silence, because "no
# gate ran" and "the gate passed" are different facts and a caller that cannot
# tell them apart will report the wrong one.
